# Reactweatherforecast

Originally made in spring 2021 as a course project. The goal was to make a responsive and user friendly web page. The project after the course has been expanded to use [FMI Open Data WFS service](https://en.ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/open-data-manual-fmi-wfs-services) for forecast fetching and further data flow management in React.
